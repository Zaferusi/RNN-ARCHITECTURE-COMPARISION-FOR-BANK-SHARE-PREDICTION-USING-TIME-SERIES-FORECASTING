This repository aims to construct simple RNN models to predict bank share value.

Folder consist of 4 different RNNN architecture.

1-SimpleRNN Method
2-LSTM Method
3-Transformers Method

All these models are generally used for different AI tasks like text to speech conversation, non-markovian control, time series classification and time series prediction.

This repository just aims to show how to use RNN architecture for time series prediction. 

To understand these models difference from classic neural networks and the key difference from each other and error metrics follow the next repositories.
